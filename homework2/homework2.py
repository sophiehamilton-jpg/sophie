# Questions (Answer these in the homework2.py file as comments):

# 1) What’s the difference between Git, GitHub, and Git Bash?

# Git is the technology that allows multiple people to work on a coding project at once. GitHub is the online interface that 
# hosts Git projects, and GitBash is the Windows version of the interface.

# 2) What’s the difference between the terminal and the command line?

# The terminal is the interface, the command line is where you enter commands. The terminal hosts the command line.

# 3) How does Windows PowerShell differ from Git Bash?

# PowerShell and Git Bash use  different commands.

# 4) What’s the difference between Anaconda, conda, and Python?

# Python is the coding language, Anaconda is the platform that hosts Python, and conda is a content manager that comes with 
# Anaconda.

# 5) What is VS Code? 

# VS Code is a software for coding Python.

# 6) What is a Jupyter Notebook? How is it different from Jupyter Lab?

# A Jupyter Notebook is the folder on Jupyter Lab that holds your script.

# 7) What does ~/ mean?

# ~/ means that you are in your most central repository.

# 8) What’s the difference between an absolute path and a relative path?

# An absolute path shows the entire path to get to a file, beggining from the 
# main directory. A relative path shows the path to get to a file relative to your current directory.

# 9) Imagine you're in your "yourname" repo. Write the absolute and relative paths to "course_assignments/homework2".

# ~/python_decal_fa25/course_assignments/
# cd ~/python_decal_fa25/course_assignments/

# 10) What command lets you move from "course_assignments/homework2/" to "course_assignments/"?

# cd ..

# 11) What would rm ./ do in your current directory? (Don’t try it!)

# That would remove my homework2.py file.

# 12) What do the following commands do?
# git add

# Adds my file to the Git repository

# git commit

# Saves my file locally.

# git push

# Saves my file remotely.

# 13) What's the difference between "git add ." and "git add <file>"?

# Git add <file> allows you to specify which file you're saving. Git add . adds your current 
# directory as a repository.

# 14) What do "git status" and "git log -1" do?

# Git status shows the status of the files in your repository. Git log -1 displays every commit 
# (shows every time you've saved) in the repository's history.

# 15) What’s the difference between cloning a repository and pulling from it?

# Cloning a repository is making a copy of someone else's remote repository. Pulling from a 
# repository is downloading the new changes from that repository.

# 16) What has been your most frustrating bug or error in this class so far? How did you troubleshoot or fix it?

# I accidentally saved a file to the wrong repository and had to learn how to delete a file on 
# terminal.

# 17) What’s a question you still have? What’s something you’re confused about?

# I'm still confused about how to save files to git after I've edited them in VS Code.

# 18) Tell me a fun fact!

# Graphite and diamond are made of the same element!

# 19) Print your favorite math expression you've learned in Python so far. 
# (Hint: Use print() and add a comment explaining what it does.)

print(5 % 2)
# This command returns the remainder after dividing 5 by 2.
